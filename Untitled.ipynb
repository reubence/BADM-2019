This is only a real distance for\n            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.\n            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)\n            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but\n            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like\n            objects in case of conflict.\n        hoverlabel\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        hovermode\n            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If\n            `clickmode` includes the \"select\" flag, `hovermode`\n            defaults to \"closest\". If `clickmode` lacks the\n            \"select\" flag, it defaults to \"x\" or \"y\" (depending on\n            the trace's `orientation` value) for plots based on\n            cartesian coordinates. For anything else the default\n            value is \"closest\".\n        images\n            A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Image instances\n            or dicts with compatible properties\n        imagedefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default\n            property values to use for elements of layout.images\n        legend\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Legend instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        mapbox\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        margin\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in\n            various `text` attributes.

Alternatively, this may\n            be specified as an instance of\n            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are\n            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container\n            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An\n            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)\n            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a\n            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array\n            for an item with matching `name` and apply that\n            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the\n            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced\n            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be\n            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for\n            example.

For example,\n            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y\n            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and\n            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is\n            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`\n            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range\n            will retain any user-driven zoom.\n        updatemenus\n            A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        updatemenudefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.updatemenus\n        violingap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of\n            adjacent location coordinates.

Has no effect on traces that have\n            \"width\" set.\n        calendar\n            Sets the default calendar system to use for\n            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.\n        clickmode\n            Determines the mode of single click interactions.\n            \"event\" is the default value and emits the\n            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the\n            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes \"lasso\" and\n            \"select\", but with no event data attached (kept for\n            compatibility reasons). The \"select\" flag enables\n            selecting single data points via click. This mode also\n            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing\n            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an\n            existing selection. \"select\" with `hovermode`: \"x\" can\n            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:\n            \"closest\" when using this feature. Selection events are\n            sent accordingly as long as \"event\" flag is set as\n            well. When the \"event\" flag is missing, `plotly_click`\n            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.\n        coloraxis\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        colorway\n            Sets the default trace colors.\n        datarevision\n            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that\n            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can\n            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete\n            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,\n            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being\n            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a\n            different identity from its predecessor contains new\n            data.\n        direction\n            Legacy polar charts are deprecated!

This is intended to reduce the likelihood of\n            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but\n            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the\n            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.\n        font\n            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces\n            and other layout components inherit from the global\n            font.\n        funnelareacolorway\n            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to\n            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you\n            specify a new list here it can still be extended with\n            lighter and darker colors, see\n            `extendfunnelareacolors`.\n        funnelgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        funnelgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        funnelmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph.

This is only a real distance for\n            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.\n            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)\n            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but\n            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like\n            objects in case of conflict.\n        hoverlabel\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        hovermode\n            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If\n            `clickmode` includes the \"select\" flag, `hovermode`\n            defaults to \"closest\". If `clickmode` lacks the\n            \"select\" flag, it defaults to \"x\" or \"y\" (depending on\n            the trace's `orientation` value) for plots based on\n            cartesian coordinates. For anything else the default\n            value is \"closest\".\n        images\n            A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Image instances\n            or dicts with compatible properties\n        imagedefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default\n            property values to use for elements of layout.images\n        legend\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Legend instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        mapbox\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Mapbox instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        margin\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Margin instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in\n            various `text` attributes.

Defaults to the main\n            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new\n            list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.\n        plot_bgcolor\n            Sets the color of plotting area in-between x and y\n            axes.\n        polar\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Polar instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        radialaxis\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.RadialAxis instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        scene\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Scene instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        selectdirection\n            When \"dragmode\" is set to \"select\", this limits the\n            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or\n            diagonal. \"h\" only allows horizontal selection, \"v\"\n            only vertical, \"d\" only diagonal and \"any\" sets no\n            limit.\n        selectionrevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected\n            points from all traces.\n        separators\n            Sets the decimal and thousand separators.

Default is\n            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)\n            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the\n            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One\n            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.\n        sliders\n            A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider instances\n            or dicts with compatible properties\n        sliderdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.sliders\n        spikedistance\n            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data\n            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no\n            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does\n            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some\n            objects can be hovered on but will not generate\n            spikelines, such as scatter fills.\n        sunburstcolorway\n            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the\n            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a\n            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.\n        template\n            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This\n            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':\n            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,\n            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching\n            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is\n            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type\n            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may\n            be specified as an instance of\n            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are\n            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container\n            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An\n            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)\n            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a\n            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array\n            for an item with matching `name` and apply that\n            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the\n            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced\n            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be\n            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for\n            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make\n            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:\n            false`.\n        ternary\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        title\n            plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        titlefont\n            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets\n            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be\n            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.\n        transition\n            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react\n            updates.\n        uirevision\n            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to\n            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of\n            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if\n            it is given and it changed from the previous\n            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If\n            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any\n            attribute that has been affected by user interactions\n            and did not receive a different value in the new figure\n            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`\n            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`\n            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control\n            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,\n            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y\n            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and\n            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is\n            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`\n            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range\n            will retain any user-driven zoom.\n        updatemenus\n            A tuple of plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        updatemenudefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.updatemenus\n        violingap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of\n            adjacent location coordinates.
